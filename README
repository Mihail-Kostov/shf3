= SHF3 =
Modular Bash framework for Unix

== Install ==
  cd $HOME
  git clone git://github.com/hornos/shf3.git

Source and setup the Shell Framework in $HOME/.profile or .bashrc:
  source $HOME/shf3/bin/shfrc

== Update ==
Update the framework:
  shfupd

== Scripting ==
=== Libraries / Namespaces ===
Libraries are kept under the shf3/lib/ directory. Each subdirectory is a namespace. Each namespace (directory) contains the following files in load order:
  kernel - function definitions
  [config] - variables
  [config.$OSTYPE] - OS specific variables  
  [config.$USER] - user specific variables

In a script a namespace is imported by:
  import lib1/lib2

 Function and variable names are prefixed by the namespace:
  a function in shf3/lib/lib1/lib2 is function lib1/lib2/function() {...
  a variable in shf3/lib/lib1/lib2 is lib1_lib2_variable=...

=== Meta ID (MID) ===
Meta ID is a data object (bag) like a json or yml file. These files contains KEY=VALUE pairs.

=== Directories ===
The most important directories are:
  bin - scripts 
  lib - libraries
  mid - mid files
  key - key files

=== Operators ===
String values can have operators at the 1st character. Default operators are: < + - . Operator clean value of a variable can be obtained by:
  ns/op/value $var

=== Framework Scripts ===
Framework scripts should contain the following header after the shebang:
  source $(dirname ${BASH_SOURCE})/../lib/header

==== Extensions Scripts ====
Extension script should refer the framework header more directly. Eg. the a script in shf3.ext/bin would do:
  source $(dirname ${BASH_SOURCE})/../../shf3/lib/header
  or
  source ${HOME}/shf3/lib/header
Libraries under <code>shf3.ext/lib</code> are added to the import path by:
  include $(dirname ${BASH_SOURCE})/../lib

=== CLI ===
There is an interactive interface for testing and for the internal help:
  shfcli
To get help:
  help
  help namespace
